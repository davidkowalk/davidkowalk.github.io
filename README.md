# Hey, Welcome to my GitHub page!

Hey, I'm David. I develop in Python, Java and I'm currently learning C. I came into contact with programming quite early, especially scripting and markup languages.

Like everyone else, the first things I made were terrible and some are on display on my GitHub page until today. Check them out if you want a good laugh :)

I have since moved onto things you might call "not terrible". My most recent project was the [ams-transpiler](https://github.com/davidkowalk/advanced_minecraft_scripting) for Minecraft scripting functions, because apparently that's my understanding of fun. Other projects worth checking out are the [Polynomial Synthesizer](https://github.com/davidkowalk/FunctionSynthesizer) and the [Weather Scraper](https://github.com/davidkowalk/WeatherScraper).

My life plan is to study physics and work in space-exploration. We'll see how that turns out. Until then I'm doing some tutoring on the side.
